👋 Hi, I’m Lewis Dickens.  
I’m currently studying for a BSc in Computing with Electronic Engineering with the Open University, building a strong foundation in both hardware and software.

🔌 Aspiring Electrical & Embedded Systems Engineer  
I’m actively developing my skills through practical projects involving embedded systems, circuit design, and microcontroller programming. My goal is to transition into a professional electrical engineering role where I can apply and expand these capabilities.

🛠️ Technical Focus Areas

Electronic circuit design and schematic development using KiCad

Embedded programming in C++ and application development in Python

Hands‑on prototyping with Elegoo microcontrollers, sensors, and a wide range of electronic components

Power electronics, PCB design, and system‑level debugging

🎯 What I’m working toward  
I’m building a portfolio of real, working engineering projects to demonstrate my problem‑solving ability, technical depth, and commitment to continuous learning.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Programming
C++ – embedded systems, microcontroller programming

Python – automation, data processing, prototyping

Electronics & Design
KiCad – schematic capture, PCB design, power electronics

Elegoo / Arduino‑compatible microcontrollers

Breadboard prototyping, sensors, actuators, power regulation

Software & Development Tools
VS Code – primary development environment

Git & GitHub – version control and project documentation

💂🏽‍♂️ Veteran  
Proud of my background and the discipline, resilience, and teamwork it has instilled in me.

Thanks for taking the time to explore my work — I’m excited to keep growing and sharing my engineering journey.
